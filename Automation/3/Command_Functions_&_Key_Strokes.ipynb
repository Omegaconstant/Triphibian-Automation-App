    "  <h5>3b. Given that there are a few functions like the above like pitchUp, pitchDown, rollLeft, rollRight, yawLeft, yawRight, Thrust, Stop, etc. Fill in the code below, in as many ways as possible, to run a particular function on a particular key press. Which is the best method? NOTE: knowledge of pynput is NOT needed. Just assume that calling on_press(key) runs the corresponding function. Eg: on_press(left) should call rollLeft()</h5>\n",

    "  <p>The following Code goes as follows :\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "      <li>1stly import Necessary Modules.</li>\n",
    "      <li>Define set() SIGNAL with all possible keystrokes we are gonna consider: basically alphanumeric keys from '0' to '9'.\n",
    "      <br>Another set() KEY has been declared to store currently active key. This has been done to store multiple keycodes, if corresponding keys are hold simultaneously.\n",
    "      <br />\n",
    "      Dummy numerical variable count & list[] keys have been declared to temporarily store a particular active key stroke before writing into a file 'log.txt'.This has been done so that with a sudden close of the system we don't loose the history of active keys pressed.By active it means any key '0' to '9'+Key.esc .\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>Now declare the Command functions using motor-mixing algorithm. Function Static() does nothing, only returns true; only have been added so that no. of Command Functions become 10 :)Anyways it doent take much space.\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>Now comes the crucial part.\n",
    "      <br>Address global variable count & keys\n",
    "      <br /> Add any keycode to KEY if it is in set SIGNAL.Again this has been done to keep in check of multiple key presses so that multiple functions can be called simultaneously. U may notice a Function called on_release just before the code ends. It basically removes the key once you release an active key.\n",
    "      <br />Now if Key.esc is pressed stop the listener.\n",
    "      <br>Now if the keycode is '5' & it is in set KEY, then \n",
    "      <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Call Static()</li>\n",
    "        <li>Store keycode in variable Key</li>\n",
    "        <li>Append that to list keys</li>\n",
    "        <li>count ++ </li>\n",
    "        <li>Now count >= 1 ## Instead we can also do count >= 10, which will append the currently active keys to file log.txt in a group of 10 entries</li>\n",
    "        <li>Call function write_file with input keys, which will append current key to log.txt file</li>\n",
    "        <li>Print the active key pressed.</li>\n",
    "      </ul>\n",
    "      Similarly do for other command functions as well\n",
    "          <ul>\n",
    "              <li>2 for pitchDown(), 8 for pitchUp()</li>\n",
    "      <li>4 for rollLeft(), 6 for rollRight()</li>\n",
    "      <li>1 for ThrustDown(), 9 for ThrustUp()</li>\n",
    "      <li>3,7 yawLeft() & yawRight() respectively</li>\n",
    "      <li>0 for Stop()\n",
    "          </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>Now we have already a blank file log.txt.With write_file function open it in append mode & add the currently active key in with removing '' & add a '\\n'.</li>\n",
    "    <li>on_release has been discussed earlier. In exception block just pass without doing anything.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Now with on_press & on_release join the listener.</li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "    The thing is this code can call multiple functions simultaneously with multiple simultaneous active key press.If we declare everything with only if separated Call of function & suppose we press '1' & '2' simultaneously, it would have taken only the input which was clicked 1st. But this is more interactve & a better method.\n",
